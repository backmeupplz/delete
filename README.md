> Attention! Facebook doesn't allow apps to delete content that hasn't been created by this app. Unfortunately, the idea of simple posts deletion is impossible to implement at the moment of writing this message. Maybe at some point in future Facebook will ease their limits and this website will be up. Cheers!

## [Delete.live](https://delete.live) source code
The code of the website that allows you to remove data from Facebook with a press of a button. Hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Please, don't mind the mess in this repository. It includes the modules necessary for the development. Thank you!
