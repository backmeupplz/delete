      <p>Whatever the reason you landed here: whether you want to clean up your Facebook profile to appear more professional, remove the mess you made before (we all had those posts that we are ashamed of now, 10 years after they were made) or anything else — you are at the right spot.</p>
      <p>Even though you won't be able to delete the data from Facebook servers, this website can at least help you to delete the public data available on the Internet. Just login to Facebook below, select what you want to delete and hit the <code>Delete</code> button. Delete — and live.</p>
      <p>Oh, and did I mention that this website is completely <a href="https://github.com/backmeupplz/delete">open source</a> and hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>? Don't take my word for the privacy of this website — go check it out yourself. None of your data is getting anywhere. None of the statistics is gathered. No cookies are used. No filthy stuff. Stars on GitHub are welcome though!</p>
